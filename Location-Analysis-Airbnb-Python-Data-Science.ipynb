    "Visiting Tokyo feels like taking a trip to the future. Robots serve and deliver your food. Vending machines sell everything — from umbrellas to puppies. This modern world is combined with old traditions and creates a unique place. It is no wonder that Tokyo attracts countless tourists every year. Therefore Tokyo has been a growing market for property owners renting out their space for the public; 民泊 or minpaku as they would call it in Japanese. Like everywhere else in the world, Airbnb has started to take over a large part of the hotel industry through its disruptive business model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since Airbnb is already playing a major role for tourism in Tokyo and is likely to continue to do so in the future, I would like to perform a data-driven location analysis for possible new Airbnbs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tokyo is the de facto capital and most populous prefecture of Japan, which is located at the head of Tokyo Bay. As of 2021, the prefecture has an estimated population of 13,960,236. The Greater Tokyo Area is the most populous metropolitan area in the world, with more than 37.393 million residents as of 2020. This large city attracts more tourists every year — tourism is steadily increasing. It is very likely that the COVID-19 period is just an exception to this trend. I expect an rebound in this sector when COVID-19 is largely and effectively treatable or preventable. This rebound is also one reason why many people fear inflation, but that is another topic.\n",
    "\n",
    "To figure out where it would be worthwhile to open an Airbnb in Tokyo, we need to understand the supply and demand relationship first. When supply noticeably exceeds demand, strong competition is likely to occur, often leading to price wars. At the end of this process the market equilibrium will be restored by the exit of market participants. This circumstance leads us to the first principle of this analysis:\n",
    "- If a new Airbnb is to be opened, competition in the surrounding area should be at a healthy level.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s take a look at the demand. In Tokyo, everything can be reached very well by the public transport network. Nevertheless, it can be assumed that tourists want to be surrounded by certain venues and do not want to be too far away from the city center. Tourists tend to like traditional sushi bars, authentic local ramen stalls and extraordinary coffee shops nearby. The bottom line is that it should be an area where tourist can discover a lot, which leads us to the second principle:\n",
    "- If an new Airbnb is to be opened, the area should have top rated venues which are relevant for tourists and the location should not be too far away from the city center.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is to identify places in Tokyo that fulfill both principles."

To achieve this goal the competitive situation as well as the environment were analyzed with the help of public available data. My secondary research has shown that the results obtained are most likely correct. However, I do not recommend making a final decision based on this analysis only. In most cases a meaningful analysis should consist of qualitative and quantitative data. Therefore this analysis can be used as a filter to focus the qualitative research on the right areas.\n",
